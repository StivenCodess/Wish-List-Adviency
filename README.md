# WISH LIST ADVIENCY

A simple wish list that I made to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript.

### DAY 1
My first day was pretty easy. Just use HTML and CSS. This was my first design.

### DAY 2
With a little more CSS I added a background that I created in Photoshop. And I gave it a blur.

### DAY 3
I added functionality with Javascript. Implement a form to add items to the list.

### DAY 5
Button to delete all elements at once. Obviously with a simple animation to give the user a better experience.
